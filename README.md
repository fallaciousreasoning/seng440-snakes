# SNAKES

The first SENG440 project, created by Jay and Dion.

When complete, this should be a not-so-simple snake game that interacts with minecraft and uses magical sensor data that we have summoned from the unearthly beyond (or, y'know, sockets).

## Using the Sensor Injector

-/ Enable sensor injection in the app (settings -> debug)
-/ Point the app at the sensor injector's ip
-/ Change the input method to accelerometer or compass
-/ Inject data with wasd for accelerometer or arrow keys for compass

You should ensure that the sensor injector is running before starting the app
